1. Project Setup
Organize the Project: Use the project structure defined above to organize files and code.
Install Dependencies: List all necessary dependencies in requirements.txt.
Version Control: Initialize a Git repository and create a .gitignore file.
Documentation: Create a README.md file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- Set up Docker and Docker Compose for containerization.
- Configure PostgreSQL database in the Docker environment.

2. Error Handling and Logging
Implement a centralized error handling system in utils/error_handling.py.
Set up a logging system to track errors, warnings, and important events during execution.
Integrate error handling and logging throughout the project.

3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect Stock Data: Use yfinance to collect historical stock data.
Preprocess Data: Prepare the data for indicators and LSTM training.
Implement data validation and error checking in the data collection and preprocessing steps.
- Implement database operations in utils/database.py for storing and retrieving data from PostgreSQL.

4. Indicator Implementation (Moving Average and RSI)
Moving Averages and RSI: Implement moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day) and RSI (14-day) in indicators.py.
Use in Trading Strategy: In signal_generator.py, use these indicators to generate buy/sell signals:
Buy: When the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA, and/or RSI is below 30 (oversold).
Sell: When the 50-day MA crosses below the 200-day MA, and/or RSI is above 70 (overbought).
Use these indicators to generate buy/sell signals in signal_generator.py.

5. LSTM Model Implementation
Feature Engineering: Use Moving Averages and RSI as additional features for the LSTM model.
LSTM Model: Define and train the LSTM model to predict future stock prices.

6. Backtesting
Implement a backtesting system for both the Moving Average/RSI strategy and the LSTM model.
Use historical data to simulate trades and calculate returns.

7. Risk Management and Signal Generation
Implement risk management strategies in risk_management.py.
Combine strategies and integrate risk management into signal generation.

8. Performance Metrics and Evaluation
Define clear metrics for evaluating the bot's performance in performance_metrics.py.
Implement a system to track and report these metrics over time.

9. Scalability Considerations
Design the system to handle multiple stocks or assets simultaneously.
Implement efficient data storage and retrieval methods for handling larger datasets.
- Optimize database queries and indexing for efficient data retrieval with multiple assets.

10. Periodic Model Retraining
Implement a mechanism for periodic retraining of the LSTM model.
Set up a schedule or trigger for model retraining based on performance metrics or time intervals.

11. Live Trading Setup
Integrate the bot with a live trading API.
Implement safeguards and circuit breakers for live trading.

12. Paper Trading Implementation
- Develop paper_trading.py to simulate real-time trading without using real money.
- Implement functionality to track paper trading performance and compare it with live trading results.
- Ensure paper trading uses real-time market data but simulates order execution.
- Store paper trading results in the PostgreSQL database for analysis and comparison.

13. Testing
Develop comprehensive unit tests for all major components.
Implement integration tests to ensure different parts of the system work together correctly.
- Add tests for paper trading functionality and database operations.

14. Visualization and Reporting
Create visualizations for strategy performance, trade signals, and model predictions.
Implement a reporting system to generate regular performance reports.
- Create visualizations to compare paper trading and live trading performance.

15. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Include database migration scripts in the CI/CD pipeline.

16. Documentation and Code Review
Write comprehensive documentation for all major components and functions.
Conduct regular code reviews to maintain code quality and consistency.
- Document database schema and operations.
- Provide instructions for setting up and managing the PostgreSQL database in the Docker environment.

17. Security Considerations
Implement secure handling of API keys and sensitive data.
Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Implement secure database connections and credential management.
