Objective:
Your goal is to develop a stock trading bot that uses both traditional technical indicators (Moving Averages and RSI) and a machine learning model (LSTM) to predict stock price movements and execute profitable swing trades in the stock market.

Approach:
You will start by implementing simpler strategies based on Moving Averages and RSI to generate buy/sell signals. Then, you will enhance the botâ€™s performance by incorporating an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict future stock prices using historical price data and technical indicators.

Key Steps:
Data Collection:

Collect historical stock data (daily or 4-hour intervals) using the yfinance API.

Technical Indicators:

Implement Moving Averages (50-day and 200-day) and RSI (14-day) to generate initial buy/sell signals.
Backtest these strategies to evaluate their performance over historical data.

LSTM Model:

Build and train an LSTM model using historical stock price data and additional features like Moving Averages and RSI.
Backtest the LSTM-based predictions to compare their performance with traditional strategies.

Risk Management:

Implement stop-loss and take-profit rules to manage risk and maximize profitability in both the traditional and LSTM strategies.

Paper Trading:

Before live trading, integrate your bot with a paper trading API (e.g., Alpaca's paper trading feature) to simulate real trades without using actual money.
Test the bot's performance in a real-world environment with simulated trades, ensuring that both the Moving Average/RSI strategy and the LSTM model can function correctly under real-time market conditions.

Live Trading:

Once the paper trading phase shows promising results, integrate your bot with a live trading API (e.g., Alpaca or Interactive Brokers) to execute real trades based on signals generated by the technical indicators and LSTM predictions.
Continue to monitor performance and adjust risk management and strategy parameters as needed.

Goal:
By combining traditional technical analysis methods with machine learning, you aim to create a trading bot capable of generating profitable trades with a focus on swing trading. The use of LSTM will potentially enhance your bot's ability to predict medium-term trends, improving its decision-making compared to basic technical indicators alone.
